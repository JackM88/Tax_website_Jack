        <p>We specialize in YOU, the driver. Whether you are an owner-operator or a company driver, you work hard for your money and we want you to 
            keep as much of it as possible. The Trucking/Transportation Industry is a unique one and most drivers are unaware of all the deductions 
            possible for them to take. We have developed our Driver Supplement to help our drivers identify all deductions possible when it comes to 
            their taxes. We understand the trucking industry and will work with you to stay current on your taxes or help you get caught up from past 
            years of not filing. Contact us today to see how we can help you save money!

             our bookkeeping and accounting services. We want to be THE tax firm for truck drivers which is why we welcome input from our clients

             can help our clients more.</p>
